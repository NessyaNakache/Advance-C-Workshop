/*

Build a calculator that can handle either real or complex numbers.
Real numbers have high precision, while complex numbers can have lower precision.

Add the following functionality:
Ask the user for a number type: Real or complex
Receive a number (real or complex) from the user
Ask the user for an operation: Add, subtract, multiply, divide, or exit
If not exit: Receive another number from the user. The user may choose a different type than the last one.
Perform the operation and display the results
Back to step iii.
